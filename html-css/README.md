# HTML & CSS

I'm going to be using this tutorial from SuperSimpleDev:

## Why are you using Iconify whilst being a beginner?

Well, technically I'm not a beginner but it's been like a month and a half since I watched this tutorial. I know, that isn't that long and I could definitely get back into it.
However, I want to *make sure* I didn't miss anything, lest I start out with bad habits.

I'm using Iconify because I want to learn about which style I prefer, since I will definitely be using it in stuff like React apps.

Also, tbh, it isn't bad to go over the basics!

# Why are you using boilerplate code?

Because Live Server doesn't work without it and I still have a pretty good idea about it (plus the tutorial will later go on about it)

Also, I'm running this whole thing on codespaces so it's not like I can just open it up on my browser...
