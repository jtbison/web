# HTML & CSS

I'm going to be using this tutorial from SuperSimpleDev:

## Why are you using Iconify whilst being a beginner?

Well, technically I'm not a beginner but it's been like a month and a half since I watched this tutorial. I know, that isn't that long and I could definitely get back into it.
However, I want to *make sure* I didn't miss anything, lest I start out with bad habits.

I'm using Iconify because I want to learn about which style I prefer, since I will definitely be using it in stuff like React apps.

Also, tbh, it isn't bad to go over the basics!
